# Data Generator

This module arose, because the data supplied
by the panels can not be accessed due to the policies of the
ITCR and problems with the obtaining of the data at the moment,
because as mentioned earlier the process is done
manually For this reason, it was necessary to generate
data from an analysis of the information that we
was provided with respect to each of the investors. The
information is composed of data such as date, serial and
energy production W/h.
